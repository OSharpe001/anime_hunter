                <h1>Welcome to Anime Hunters' HQ!</h1>
                <p>
                    Feel free to peruse our Bounty Board and add a new bounty to your Bingo Book.
                    <br/>
                    The Bounty Board is already pre-loaded for beginners with the highest ranking
                    bounties without the fuss of using the search form.
                    <br/>
                    You can get more specific bounties when you "Begin The Hunt" and enter a title
                    or genres into the search form.
                    <br/>
                    The Bingo Book is where you'll keep note of the bounties that catch your eye.
                    This is your personal book so all of your most savory prey will be kept in a place
                    you can always refer back to. After completing a bounty (watching your anime),
                    simply scratch'em off your list. If after trailing and scouting your prey, you
                    feel as if they're not worth the time and effort, you can erase them completely!
                    <br/>
                    You can also take a closer look at the profile of your prospective prey by
                    clicking on their poster in the Bounty Board and then traveling to the Poster page.
                    Here, you'll be able to study their features, giving you a better chance to find
                    clues and sniff-out their trail...
                    <br/>
                    With all of these features, there's no way you'll lose sight of your prey!
                </p>
